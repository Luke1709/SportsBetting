Simple model that predicts the probability of the amount of goals in a specific game.

The model has been built to calculate the expected goals for certain teams using historical data. Using the xG calculated, we can calculate odds for certain scorelines and number of goals to compare them to the bookmakers.

The model produced is very basic but the concept is to find gaps in the market that provide us with value.
